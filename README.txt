In order to run the android application:
Step 1. Install and setup Android Studio. There are plenty of online resources that go through the process step by step.
Step 2. Install and setup a virtual device, or plug in a physical android device.
Step 3. The configurations should be app by default, but if not switch run configurations to app.
Step 4. Click the 'run app' button, or hit shift + F10.
Step 5. The application should be now running. Android studio is very slow, so it may take some time for the application to fully load.
